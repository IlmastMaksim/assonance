                <p>The purpose of the app is to create a web portal that would allow musicians and bands to connect with each other for mutual rehearsals and subsequent partnership.</p>
                <p>Users may create notifications in order to declare that they are looking for musicians/band.</p>
                <p>Published notifications can be answered by other users via applying for them. Thereafter publishers may see and loop through acquired applications.</p>
